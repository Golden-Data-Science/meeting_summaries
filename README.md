# meeting_summaries

## July 2017
- Andy P. showed some work he started looking at stream gauge data on Clear Creek (<https://github.com/andypicke/clear_creek>).
- Natalya R. showed us her work so far on the Kaggle housing data. She tried lots of models!
- Charles C. showed us some of his software for automatically checking data quality, identifing issues, and cleaning.
- Scott F. actually just finished a project on the housing data for a General assembly class, and gave us a quick presentation of his results. I think he has the best score so far out of our group!
- We decided to continue working on the housing data until the next meeting.
